# 1. Feedback of Data Quality
Interactivity needed?

* in some way, complex/high dimensional data has to be visualized

* __busy__ clinicans/investigator need all information on the __first look__

* on demand: __filtering__, __selecting__, __zooming__ 

* dynamic, simple, accessible --> __web-based & real-time applications__

# 2. TxCohort
### Transplantation Cohort - an Infrastructure of the German Center for Infection Control (DZIF)


* multicenter study with ~600 participants (all ages)

* participants after transplation of heart, lung, pancreas, kidneys, liver or stem cells

* __primary aim__: organ transplantation and its influence on <br>infection susceptibility and organ function

* 14 heterogene patient records (demography, postoperative procedures, <br> bacterial infections, etc.)

* monthly exports with in separate csv files <br> (5 centers x 6 organs x 14 records)

# 3. TxDashboard

### Needs Assessment 

* Study Nurses, Clinicans, (Local-) Investigators

* content: 
    + Study Population / Recruitment Rate
    + Biosamples
    + Follow-up Performance
    + Data Quality
    
* common scripting language researcher and clinican (can) understand:
    + __language__: `R`
    + __documentation__: `rmarkdown`
    + __graphs__: `ggplot2`, `googleVis`, `leaflet`, `plotly`
    + __tables__: `knitr`, `kableExtra`, `DT`
    
* single page, quick to understand

# 3. TxDashboard

Demonstration

# 4. What's next?



* Extension of data quality assessment (more dimensions & indicators in regards to user needs)

* implementation of gamified features (leaderboards, awards, badges)

* measuring user interaction (user research)

* extension to `angular.js`/`shiny` frameworks (more flexibility)
